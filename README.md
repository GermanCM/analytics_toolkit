# Analytics_toolkit
This is a repository to allocate internal utilities for several steps in an analytics pipeline, like exploratory analysis, visualizations, data extraction, etc

This includes the use of external open source packages like pandas_profiling, which helps to automate some discovery steps about medium size datasets.

The idea is to implement helpers in the fashion of object-oriented programming, to make it more reusable; we can also use the concept of snippets, in case a code is a little standalone helper.
